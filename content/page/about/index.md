## Who am I?
Hi! My name is Rex. **I design modular synth modules for fun!** 

I learned how to do electronics on the web and have been tinkering with electronics my whole life. I'm also an IT grad - I code from time to time.

## What is this blog for?
This blog is for sharing my DIY synth journey. This would hopefully help you build your own modular synth in no time!
